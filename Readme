# COSC 257 Assignments

This repository was created for the COSC 257 course. The course has eight assignments, as follows:

## week1_p1

Your submission for this assignment must include the following:

- Makefile to run the final program from given lex and yacc files.
- A complete lexical (lex file) analyzer for a miniC program.
- A partial parser (yacc file) for miniC program that has rules for parsing the following miniC statements:
  - Variable declarations
  - Assignment statements
  - Return statements
  - If, if-else statements (Note: some if statements will not have an associated else statement)

## week2_p2

For this assignment you will do the following:

1. Creating an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the input miniC program using AST library that I have shared with you. In your yacc file you should have a global variable that will hold the root of the AST at the end of parsing phase.

2. You will be write a semantic analysis function that will check if every variable is declared before it is used. This function will take the root of the AST created in the YACC file as a parameter and will be called after you call yyparse() in your main function. You can find the details of the semantic analysis here: Semantic Analysis (week2_p1)
