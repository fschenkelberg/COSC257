# This Assignment Submission For week1_p1 Contains The Following Components:
1. The makefile to run the final program from given lex and yacc files.
2. The complete lexical (lex file) analyzer for a miniC program.
3. A partial parser (yacc file) for miniC program that has rules for parsing the following miniC statements:
-Variable declarations
-Assignment statements
-Return statements
-If, if-else statements

## The Changes That Were Implemmented:
1. Non-terminals were renamed to use lowercase names.
2. The number of tokens in the lex file was reduced to only those needed for miniC.
3. Tokens for whitespace (WSP) were removed.
4. Rules for comments and any other components not necessary for this assignment were removed.
5. The issue of the original parser accepting programs not written in miniC was resolved.

## Directions:
To run this parser:

```
make
./test.out < sample_miniC.c
```
