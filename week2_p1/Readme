# This Assignment Submission For week2_p1  Contains The Following Components:
1. An abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the input miniC program using AST library. In your yacc file you should have a global variable that will hold the root of the AST at the end of parsing phase.

2. A semantic analysis function that will check if every variable is declared before it is used. This function will take the root of the AST created in the YACC file as a parameter and will be called after you call yyparse() in your main function.
 
## Directions:
To run this parser:

```
make
./test.out < sample_miniC.c
```
